# Ideas

## List
 - Print bil or bir in a more readable form
 - Do function detection, integrate with radare2
 - Debugger, then symbolic debugger
 - Plugin to read memory from debugger state. Could, for example, execute kernel to certain point, break, then run BAP which reads from this frozen debugger state.
